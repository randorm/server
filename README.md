The bot is designed for the efficient distribution of first-year students to
rooms in the dormitory of Innopolis University. The distribution procedure is
divided into three stages. At the first stage, a Telegram channel is created,
where moderators send participants' resumes (the resume template is announced in
advance by the organizers). In the second stage, participants register in the
bot, and then forward their favorite resumes to the bot. In the last stage, the
organizers process the collected data and announce the results of the
distribution.
