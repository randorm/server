The bot is designed for the efficient distribution of first-year students to
rooms in the dormitory of Innopolis University. The allocation occurs in three
phases. At the first phase, a channel is created in Telegram, where moderators
send participants' resumes (the resume template is announced in advance by the
organizers). In the second phase, participants register in the bot, and then
send favorite resumes to the bot. In the third stage, the organizers process the
data and announce the distribution results.
