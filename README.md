The bot is designed for the efficient distribution of first-year students to
rooms in the dormitory of Innopolis University. The distribution procedure is
divided into three phases. At the first phase, a Telegram channel is created,
where moderators send participants' resumes (the resume template is announced in
advance by the organizers). In the second phase, participants register in the
bot, and then forward their favorite resumes. In the last phase, the organizers
process the data and announce the distribution of students into rooms.

> As a result, students have a better chance of making not only roommates, but
> also true friends.
